##What is Open Source?##
Open Source refers to a number of different things in the field of programming. Most vaguely, an Open Source project is one where you have the liberty to get, inspect and modify the source code of the project. The projects linked to from here are properly referred to as [Free/Libre Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) rather than [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), but Open Source is also colloquially taken as an umbrella term to refer to both of these.

##So, where is the source code?##
Most of :flaviusb's open source projects can be found on his [Github page](https://github.com/flaviusb/). Other projects can be found through the index page of [his website](http://flaviusb.net).
